      <h1>PART I</h1>
      <div class="p-10">

        <p>Cybertown Revival is more than a virtual city; it is a community built on creativity,
          co-operation, and shared history. This Constitution exists to preserve the founding spirit of CTR while
          providing a fair, structured, and future-proof system of governance for all citizens.</p>

        <p>The intent of this document is to:</p>
        <ul class="p-5 list-disc">
          <li>Empower citizens to participate in shaping the city through representation, law, and service.</li>
          <li>Define the roles and limits of authority across the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches.</li>
          <li>Protect the integrity of the community, ensuring safety, fairness, and accountability.</li>
          <li>Encourage respectful collaboration, lively debate, and thoughtful decision making.</li>
          <li>Ensure continuity, so Cybertown Revival remains stable, welcoming, and prepared to evolve.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="py-5">The Constitution is designed with checks, balances, and safeguards so that no branch may
          undermine another without due cause, and no citizen is denied the opportunity to be heard within its
          jurisdiction.</p>

        <p class="py-5">CTR honors its past but does not exist in it. The city must grow, adapt, and improve. Therefore,
          this Constitution may be amended when necessary to ensure a stronger future.</p>

        <p class="py-5">All citizens, officials, and founders are expected to uphold the values of this Constitution,
          act in good faith, and place the long-term prosperity of Cybertown Revival above personal interest.</p>

        <p class="py-5">This is our framework. This is our Promise</p>

            discretion of Clubs Staff and Security, violates the Constitution will also be considered in violation of
            this policy. Citizens are warned that violating these guidelines could cause their club and all objects
            within it to be deleted without notice.</p>

        </div>

        <h5>3: Copyrights</h5>
        <div class="p-5">
          <p>Cybertown Revival, in its attempt to allow freedom of expression by its members, permits Citizens to post
            and use their own creative works in various places. However, Citizens are prohibited from posting or using
            the copyrighted material of others without their consent. Any avatar, image, object, text, etc. that is
            deemed to be in violation of a copyright is subject to deletion and/or immediate removal. At the discretion
            of the Security Officers, persons who violate copyrights may also face the appropriate consequences.</p>
          <p class="py-5">Copyright holders who feel that any copyright(s) they hold which may have been violated can
            file claims by contacting the Cybertown Revival website administrators.</p>

        </div>

        <h5>4: Unlawful Activity</h5>
        <div class="p-5">
          <p>At Cybertown Revival, we want everyone to feel safe, respected, and supported. That’s why we take any kind
            of unlawful behavior seriously — even just talking about it in a harmful way. Any form of unlawful behavior
            is taken very seriously. If you attempt, threaten, or participate in actions that disrupt the community or
            break the law, you may be removed immediately. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

          <ul class="p-5 list-disc">
            <li>Saying things that damage someone’s reputation (slander or false claims).</li>
            <li>Sharing false or misleading information that harms Cybertown Revival or slows down its progress.</li>
            <li>Sharing someone’s private conversations or emails without their permission (invasion of privacy or
              doxxing).</li>
            <li>Posting private or confidential company information (like logs or trade secrets).</li>
            <li>Breaking any agreements you’ve made (breach of contract).</li>
            <li>Trying to interfere with someone’s current or future business relationships.</li>
            <li>Taking part in, or supporting, websites that promote hate, harassment, or cyberstalking.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We reserve the right to take action against any behavior that breaks the law or threatens the safety of our
            community.</p>
          <p class="py-5">We’re here to create a positive and respectful space for everyone. If you’re ever unsure about
            something, feel free to ask Security — we’re happy to help!</p>
          <p class="py-5">Permanent bans related to unlawful acts do not qualify for review by CERB. Additionally,
            Cybertown Revival will comply with any law enforcement agency requests regarding such activities.</p>
        </div>

        <h5>5: Homes</h5>
        <div class="p-5">
          <p>Homes are generally considered to be private areas of the City. However, certain aspects of private homes
            are viewable by the public and to that extent those public aspects are regulated in the same fashion as the
            public chats. Specifically:</p>

          <ul class="p-5 list-disc">
            <li>The name and content of your home.</li>
            <li>Your home's information page.</li>
            <li>Your home’s links page.</li>
            <li>Any mail sent from your inbox.</li>
            <li>Any virtual pet.</li>
            <li>Anything you post to a message board.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These must not contain any inappropriate language/illegal content, or in the case of a virtual pet be
            programmed to use such language in its interactions with Citizens.</p>

          <p class="py-5">Your home must not contain information about any illegal activity such as software piracy.</p>
          <p class="py-5">Your home cannot be furnished with textures, texts, objects or images that would be considered
            offensive, illegal, pornographic, racist or that violate any copyrights.</p>
          <p class="py-5">If you wish to discuss things that might be considered offensive or controversial you are
            advised to use a private message method such as Discord or another private message program so that only
            Citizens who knowingly wish to participate in such conversations are allowed entry. If Security is able to
            see the chat in your home,it’s considered a public space.</p>
          <p class="py-5">Your home must comply with all other rules created by your Colony Leader and their staff.</p>
          <p class="py-5">Citizens are reminded that this list is not exhaustive and that any other similar conduct
            that, at the discretion of the Security, violates the Constitution will also be considered in violation of
            this policy. In addition to any provisions contained in the penalty section of this document, Citizens are
            warned that violating this provision could cause their home and all objects within it to be deleted without
            notice.</p>

        </div>

        <h5>6: Items/Objects</h5>
        <div class="p-5">
          <p>Cybertown Revival, in its attempt to be a virtual city, has an economic system in which Citizens are able
            to buy and sell items. In an attempt to ensure fair treatment of everyone and to see that the chats are not
            disrupted the following rules apply to the sale of Items/Objects:</p>

          <ul class="p-5 list-disc">
            <li>You are not allowed to scam, or attempt to scam other Citizens. Putting a low price on an item's
              name/description but asking much more in the price box in order to scam someone, (i.e.- 100 cc's posted at
              end of item, 1000 cc's in price box) is prohibited.</li>
            <li>You may not move other people's items to the floor of any room in Cybertown Revival without their
              permission.</li>
            <li>You may not sell in the flea market, items that are available in the mall or flea market for free.</li>
            <li>You may not take a free item and rename it in an attempt to convince another Citizen to buy it.</li>
            <li>You may not steal items or objects from other Citizens backpacks, homes, or clubs.</li>
            <li>You may not remove any credits or recognition of who made an item from an item (unless you are its
              creator)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Citizens are again reminded that this list is not exhaustive, and that at the discretion of Security, any
            other similar conduct that violates the Constitution will also be considered in violation of this policy.
          </p>

        </div>

        <h5>7: Jobs/Roles</h5>
        <div class="p-5">
          <p>Cybertown Revival, in its endeavor to emulate a virtual city, has established an economic system wherein
            Citizens are permitted to hold a job or role. Main nicknames are allowed to have a job or role.</p>

          <p class="py-5">Furthermore, it is strictly prohibited to grant access to alt nicknames, as this action will
            result in a ban. Conversely, granting access to alt nicknames will result in a 7-day ban for the main
            nickname, a 90-day probation period, and a year of having a role no higher than a basic role.</p>

          <p class="py-5">On the other hand, alt nicknames will be subject to a 30-day ban and a 90-day probation
            period, and they will not be granted any roles.</p>

          <p class="py-5">Higher roles/jobs will undergo a security check</p>
          <p class="py-5">If there is a second offense it could lead to permanent ban.</p>
          <p class="py-5">If at anytime a ban is enacted, depending on infraction, your job/role may be removed and will
            not be reinstated</p>
          <p class="py-5">No one will be put in access in an unopened block/hood. This will result in a ban. Unless that
            person is in charge of opening said block/hood.</p>

        </div>

        <h5>8: Message Boards</h5>
        <div class="p-5">
          <p>Cybertown Revival has many public message boards where Citizens can post messages, thoughts, and opinions
            for review by others. Conversations on the message boards are generally considered the same as public chats
            and are regulated in the same fashion. Comments on the message boards are at all times expected to be polite
            and constructive in nature. While communicating on the public message boards you may not:</p>

          <ul class="p-5 list-disc">
            <li>Use any racist or sexual language.</li>
            <li>Hold conversations related to illegal activity.</li>
            <li>Argue with or harassing other users. Private disputes are to be kept private and out of the public areas
              of Cybertown Revival.</li>
            <li>Insult or attempt to discredit another Citizen's reputation.</li>
            <li>Publish the contents of private e-mails or private conversations (including from inboxes).</li>
            <li>Make false statements or use derogatory innuendo or spread false information, especially in an effort to
              create turmoil, upset or uneasiness.</li>
            <li>You may not post advertisements for any outside websites</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Persistence in doing so after having been warned will cause you to forfeit your membership in Cybertown
            Revival. This does not apply to advertising Cybertown Revival events or goods or services that involve the
            city-cash currency in Cybertown Revival.</p>

          <p class="py-5">Because of the seriousness of misuse/abuse of the message boards, inflammatory or false and
            misleading message board posts as above have their own separate penalties as follows:</p>
          <ul class="p-5 list-disc">
            <li>The posting is deleted immediately and without notice and the poster receives one warning.</li>
            <li>Any repetition results in temporary loss of posting privileges. The posting privilege will be restored
              when Security is satisfied that the person will not repeat the kind of behavior that caused them to lose
              their posting privilege.</li>
            <li>If posting privileges are restored, and there is any further repetition, the poster gets a 15 day ban
              and permanent loss of posting privileges.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Citizens are again reminded that this list is not exhaustive and that, at the discretion of Security, any
            other similar conduct that violates the Constitution will also be considered in violation of this policy</p>

        </div>

        <h5>9: Nicknames</h5>
        <div class="p-5">
          <p>Nicknames cannot be profane, sexual, or drug related in nature. Nicknames created solely to harass or
            impersonate another citizen are also prohibited. Nicknames in violation will be permanently banned.</p>

        </div>

        <h5>10: Slander, Libel, and Harassment</h5>
        <div class="p-5">
          <p>As Cybertown Revival is a virtual city with a life-like political structure, Citizen's reputations are held
            in high regard and are extremely important to their continued success within the community. As such,
            harassment of a Citizen or group in an attempt to defame, damage or discredit their reputation is
            prohibited. Citizens who continue such behavior, whether in Cybertown Revival or in any other media, after
            being warned to cease will be removed from Cybertown Revival. Subject to permanent ban.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Section Two – Penalties for Infractions</h2>
        <div class="p-5">
          <p class="py-5">Cybertown Revival's goal is to ensure that everyone is able to enjoy the community and is
            treated fairly. As such, penalties for violating the rules follow a ladder system and increase in severity
            with each offense, with permanent ban being the method of last resort. Every effort will be made to give the
            Citizen a chance to reform prior to permanent ban. As stated in the Rules of Conduct, a few actions are
            considered severe enough to warrant an immediate and lengthy ban, and in those situations the ladder system
            will not be used and the penalty specified in the Rules of Conduct provision of this document will apply.
          </p>

          <p class="py-5">Step 1: A user violating any of the Rules of Conduct will be given a warning if possible. The
            warning may be issued in the chat, e-mailed, or inboxed to the Citizen as appropriate. In some cases, if in
            the opinion of Security, the offense is severe enough to warrant stronger action the warning may be skipped
            and Security shall proceed to Step 2. In any event, if the Citizen ignores the warning Security shall
            proceed to Step 2.</p>

          <p class="py-5">Step 2: The Citizen will be banned for a period not to exceed 3 days. Again this is at the
            discretion of Security and offense. At the discretion of Security this ban may either confine the Citizen to
            the City Jail or may prohibit the Citizen from entering the community entirely. A notation will also be
            placed on the Citizen's "record" of the ban, its reason, and the date it was placed. If at any time prior to
            the Citizen's record being cleared another offense is committed, Security shall proceed to Step 3.</p>

          <p class="py-5">Step 3. The Citizen shall be banned for a period of no less than 7 days and not to exceed 30
            days. If the ban is 14 days or longer a notice must be filed with CERB* and the citizen should be sent an
            email (if they have an email address on file) explaining the reason for the ban. A notation will also be
            placed on the Citizen's "record" to indicate the reason for the ban and the date it was placed.</p>

          <p class="py-5">Additional punishments may be given without any notice</p>

          <p class="py-5">If at any time prior to the Citizen's record being cleared another offense is committed,
            Security shall proceed to Step 4.</p>

          <p class="py-5">Step 4: This is the step of last resort. At this point all options for the Citizen to reform
            are considered to have been exhausted. Security shall ban the citizen for 30 days and submit a request to
            the Security Chief for a permanent ban. The Chief will review the request and, if there is proper evidence
            to support it.</p>

          <p class="py-5">Any ban enacted by the Security Chief will be reviewed -if required- by the next highest
            Security Officer not involved in the incident</p>
          <p class="py-5">If the request is approved the ban will be set for the maximum length possible. This time will
            be extended to reflect the current maximum length whenever updates to the City are made. All city-cash and
            experience points will be removed from the Citizen.</p>
          <h5>Re-admission to the City</h5>
          <div class="p-5">
            <p>Citizens who have been permanently banned may appeal the decision to CERB*. However, due to the
              seriousness of permanent bans, citizens who have received a permanent ban may only appeal the decision
              once. If this appeal fails, the account will remain banned permanently. Any appeal should be submitted
              within 6 months of the ban; appeals submitted after this time are invalid. Appeals for any non-permanent
              bans may be submitted once per year.</p>

            <p class="py-5">*In the event the role(s) of CERB are not filled, an independent review board will be formed
              to hear any appeal cases.</p>

          </div>

          <h3>Ban Evasion</h3>
          <div class="p-5">
            <p>Citizens who are banned (denied permission to enter Cybertown Revival) are expected to remain outside of
              the City for the duration of the ban. If a Citizen is caught in the City using any other nickname during
              the term of their ban, they will receive a permanent ban on all nicknames they have used.</p>

          </div>

          <h5>City Officer Impartiality</h5>
          <div class="p-5">
            <p>To preserve the integrity of the community, City Officers shall always attempt to make a consistent and
              impartial decision when reviewing violations of the UBP. No Security Officer shall issue a ban when he or
              she is directly involved in the case. The Officer shall instead log and save the incident and defer the
              decision to another Officer who is not directly involved.</p>

          </div>

          <h5>Enacted Ban Procedure</h5>
          <div class="p-5">
            <p>Once a ban has been enacted, it can not be altered or removed without either a successful CERB appeal, or
              Security Chief/Deputy Security Chief approval.</p>

            <p class="py-5">All citizens/members are asked to be courteous and mindful of other citizens/members in all
              aspects of Cybertown Revival.</p>

            <p class="py-5">Reminder,at anytime this document can change as different offenses may occur and goes into
              effect immediately</p>

            <p class="py-5">Security will not discuss bans with other members.</p>

          <p class="py-5">Citizens have two (2) weeks from the start of a ban to file an appeal. Appeals filed after
            that period will not be accepted.</p>
          <p class="py-5">Citizens may also submit a request to clear their security record after a minimum of one (1)
            year since the infraction. This request will be treated the same as the appeal process.</p>
          <p class="py-5">If the request is denied, the citizen must wait a minimum of six (6) months before submitting
            another request.</p>
          <p class="py-5">Once an appeal has been submitted, C.E.R.B. will gather the appropriate documents from the
            citizen, Security, City Council, and/or any other necessary source.</p>
          <p class="py-5">The C.E.R.B. Board will have two (2) weeks from the time all information has been submitted to
            come to a verdict.</p>
          <p class="py-5">Once deliberation between C.E.R.B. members has finished, the C.E.R.B. Chief will call for a
            vote.</p>
          <p class="py-5">A majority vote is required for an appeal to be approved.</p>
          <p class="py-5">The Chief will lead the investigation but will not vote unless there is a need for a
            tiebreaker.</p>
          <p class="py-5">C.E.R.B. decisions are final and cannot be overturned or appealed further.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 7: Citizen v. Citizen Arbitration</h2>
        <div class="p-5">
          <p>In the event there is a dispute between two citizens, one or both citizens may appeal to C.E.R.B. for
            resolution. Examples of disputes could be:</p>
          <ul class="p-5 list-disc">
            <li>A trade deal involving objects and CC’s where one side feels they were cheated or ripped off.</li>
            <li>An agreement was broken.</li>
            <li>Termination without just cause.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>C.E.R.B. does NOT handle:</p>
          <ul class="p-5 list-disc">
            <li>Harassment.</li>
            <li>Breaches of Part 3 of this document by individual citizens.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These issues should be reported to security. C.E.R.B. is meant for disputes and not initial infractions.
